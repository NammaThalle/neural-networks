Repository built for personal learning of some neural networks

1. Logistic Regression with Neural Network Mindset
   This model acts as a binary classifier. It uses a cat/non-cat data set to train the model using logistic regression and perform the optimization using the gradient descent. Once the model is trained, it shows all the statistics off the model it can be tested by giving the model a user input.
2. Single layer Neural Network
   This model acts as a non-binary classifier. It uses a planar data set to train the model using one hidden layer and perform the optimization using the gradient descent. This excercise will use non-linear activation function such as tanh.
